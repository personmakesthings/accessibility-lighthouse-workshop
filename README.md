# accessibility-lighthouse-workshop

Copy of [wk01-assignment
](https://github.com/personmakesthings/wk01-assignment) for an accessibility task using Lighthouse.



## Notes:
- Alt text has been added to page images, which was absent from the original repo.
- This has increased the accessibility score from 75 to 100 when analysed with Lighthouse.
